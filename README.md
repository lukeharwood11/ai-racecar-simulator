# Racecar Simulator

## Purpose
<hr> 

This project provides a framework to build a simulator to test different agents in a simple environment. This allows you to control the inputs/outputs of the system in python and hotswap the 'drivers' to the vehicles.

Use this repo to build your own AI drivers and test them on your own tracks!
